# Create targets.

# the DAM library of MeddySDK, we name it "MeddySDK_DAM" instead of just "DAM", because that would be very vague.

# Set output names of our targets.
#
# This determines the name of the binary files generated for the target. The name may differ from the actual
# target name. E.g., for MeddySDKCLI, we name its executable file "meddy" to suit our desired command line usage.

# Add alias targets.
#
# We name these with special characters that filenames can't have. We use these aliases instead of the direct
# target names where possible so that they can't be be interpreted as filenames.
#
# It's conventional to use "::" in these names, like namespaces. If a target doesn't have anything to namespace in its
# name then just prepend "::" to it, analogous to how we indicate global scope in cpp.
#
# The aliases set up here get used by build interface users. Make sure the same aliases are also set up for install
# interface users somewhere else. We do that in the export's config file. It's important to make sure the names are
# the same in both cases for consistency. Namely, so that build interface users can use `OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE` with
# `FetchContent_Declare()`.

# Add all header files and set up their include directories.
#
# The `BASE_DIRS` of file sets automatically get added to the target's include
# directories. So we don't use the `target_include_directories()` command anymore
# because that would be redundant.
#
# Interface and/or public file sets are important because we use them to install headers for
# the install interface users.
#
# A nice benefit of listing all header files is that they can be easily-discoverable by IDEs.
#
# We make sure to group all of our header files into a subfolder named after our project. This is
# important for avoiding include file path naming conflicts with other libraries. It also gives
# us the freedom to name our files however, while still having context in their include path names.
