# MeddySDK_Meddyproject

The Meddy project system - a library with tools to interact with "meddyprojects".

For a superproject with all components Meddy has to offer, see [MeddySDK](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDK).
- This provides the individual MeddySDK libraries, tied together with CMake.

## Dependencies

MeddySDK_Meddyproject
- ~~[boost_filesystem](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem)~~
    - This dependency has been eliminated. We now use `std::filesystem` as a replacement.

## Build System âŒ¨

Built with CMake - cross-platform, standardized, and IDE-friendly.

We provide CMake presets, which handle feeding arguments to CMake for you.

### IDE Support

Most IDEs provide built-in CMake integration.

#### VS Code

Has the "CMake Tools" and "C/C++" extensions, both developed by Microsoft.

#### Visual Studio

Has very nice integration, but they seem behind when it comes to supporting the latest CMake features. I've had experiences where I have to switch to VS Code because of this.

## Build Instructions ðŸ”¨

This project is fully isolated from its dependencies, and therefore must be tied together by a superproject. See [MeddySDKStandalone](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDKStandalone) for a complete build setup.

### 1. Invoke CMake on the Project (the Configure Step)

Command line: `cmake --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` configure preset, and "configure" the CMake project.

### 2. Invoke a Build Command

Command line: `cmake --build --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` build preset, and "build" it.

## Test Instructions ðŸ§ª

Here's how to run automated tests, to verify that our code behaves as intended.

### 1. Build the Project

See "Build Instructions" above.

### 2. Invoke CTest

Command line: `ctest --preset="meddysdk-meddyproject-windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `meddysdk-meddyproject-windows-x64-debug` test preset, and "run tests".
