# MeddySDK_Meddyproject

The Meddy project system - a library with tools to interact with "meddyprojects".

For a superproject with all components Meddy has to offer, see [MeddySDK](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDK).
- This provides the individual MeddySDK libraries, tied together with CMake.

## Dependencies

MeddySDK_Meddyproject
- ~~[boost_filesystem](https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem)~~
    - This dependency has been eliminated. We now use `std::filesystem` as a replacement.

## Project Structure

MeddySDK_Meddyproject
- Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `MeddySDK_Meddyproject` package and export.
- Subprojects
    - Include
        - Provides the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Include` (interface library).
            - This can be used as a header-only library.
        - Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `Include` component.
        - What it is: Holds all the public header files of our source code.
    - Source
        - Provided the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Source` (interface library).
        - Does it install: No, but it's a cool idea. Maybe in the future.
        - What it is: Holds all the private source files to compile.
    - Static
        - Provides the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Static` (static library).
        - Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `Static` component.
    - Shared
        - Provides the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Shared` (shared library).
        - Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `Shared` component.
    - Module
        - Provides the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Module` (module library).
        - Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `Module` component.
    - Object
        - Provides the target: `MeddySDK::Meddyproject::Object` (object library).
        - Does it install: Yes, it's installed as the `Object` component.
    - Tests
        - Does it install: No, but we should support this so that dependent projects can use our test code to help with writing their own tests.
        - What it is: Provides automated tests. See "Test Instructions" for how to use.

## Build System âŒ¨

Built with CMake - cross-platform, standardized, and IDE-friendly.

We provide CMake presets, which handle feeding arguments to CMake for you.

### IDE Support

Most IDEs provide built-in CMake integration.

#### VS Code

Has the "CMake Tools" and "C/C++" extensions, both developed by Microsoft.

#### Visual Studio

Has very nice integration, but they seem behind when it comes to supporting the latest CMake features. I've had experiences where I have to switch to VS Code because of this.

## Build Instructions ðŸ”¨

This project is fully isolated from its dependencies, and therefore must be tied together by a superproject. See [MeddySDKStandalone](https://github.com/ChristianHinko/MeddySDKStandalone) for a complete build setup.

### 1. Invoke CMake on the Project (the Configure Step)

Command line: `cmake --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` configure preset, and "configure" the CMake project.

### 2. Invoke a Build Command

Command line: `cmake --build --preset="windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `windows-x64-debug` build preset, and "build" it.

## Test Instructions ðŸ§ª

Here's how to run automated tests, to verify that our code behaves as intended.

### 1. Build the Project

See "Build Instructions" above.

### 2. Invoke CTest

Command line: `ctest --preset="meddysdk-meddyproject-windows-x64-debug"`.

IDE: Choose the `meddysdk-meddyproject-windows-x64-debug` test preset, and "run tests".
